<h2>Female Genital Mutilation risk and the summer holidays</h2>
<p>FGM is the practice of removing part or all of the external female genitalia, by cutting with a blade, for non-medical reasons. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. This highly distressing act is usually performed by a non-medically trained person, often a female elder in a community, often with rudimentary instruments and no anaesthetic.</p>
<p>FGM is solely a cultural practice, with no basis in any religious teachings. It is highly distressing, can cause severe long term  physical and psychological issues including bleeding, infection and even death.</p>
<p>Everyone has a duty to safeguard children and the issue of FGM requires services to be vigilant to the signs that a girl may be at risk of this extremely damaging and illegal act. The Summer holiday period is a particularly vulnerable time for girls from practising communities, as the long absence from school allows time for them to heal after being cut. Girls are often taken out of the country to undergo FGM, however it is now thought that cutting can happen here at home, so we all need to be aware of signs and indicators that a girl is at risk of being cut, or has actually been cut.</p>
<p>The link to the Berkshire Procedures online for FGM is below. This provides clear pathways of what to do if you are worried: <a href="http://www.proceduresonline.com/berks/reading/p_fem_gen_mutil.html?zoom_highlight=FGM">http://www.proceduresonline.com/berks/reading/p_fem_gen_mutil.html?zoom_highlight=FGM</a></p>
<p>It is vital that front line staff in all domains are vigilant to girls who may be from communities who practice FGM (<a href="/media/1195/world-map-prevalence.docx" target="_blank" title="FGM world map prevalence"><strong>see world map</strong></a>) and any potential risk posed where an extended family holiday to their homeland is planned. The list of countries on this map is not exhaustive. It is important that we are open minded.</p>]]></bodyText>

<h3>Safer Places Scheme</h3>
<p>The Safer Places scheme aims to provide people, and particularly those with a learning disability, with a safe place to go to where help can be summoned if they are feeling scared or upset while out on their own in the community. Vulnerable people can request a card where they can write their name and the phone number of their trusted person. They carry this card with them and if needed, they can show this card to the Safe Place staff who will make the phone call for them to someone they trust, who will either come and collect them or advise them on what they need to do. The Safe Places in the scheme are easily identified by the logo displayed in the front window.</p>

<p><span>The Policy and Procedures were adopted by Bracknell, Slough, Reading, West Berkshire, Windsor &amp; Maidenhead and Wokingham in April 2016. <span>They are regularly updated and staff and managers should regularly refer to the on-line version. Staff can sign up to receive email alerts for amendments.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Our vision in Berkshire is that all agencies will work together to prevent and reduce the risk of significant harm to adults at risk of abuse or neglect, whilst supporting individuals to maintain control over their lives and make informed choices without coercion. </span></p>
<h3><span><span><span><span>Amendments</span></span></span></span></h3>
<p>The Berkshire Safeguarding Adults Policy and Procedures are reviewed and amended twice yearly by the Berkshire Safeguarding Adults Policy and Procedures Group. Proposed changes will be endorsed by the three Safeguarding Adults Boards (Bracknell and Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough, and the West of Berkshire) prior to publication.</p>
<p><span><span>The Policy and Procedures were last updated on 20 November 2017.</span></span> The next scheduled review is May 2018.</p>]]></bodyText>

<h2>Mental Health Crisis Interagency Joint Working Protocol</h2>
<p>This protocol sets out the recognition that when people present, or are presented, to the Police in a mental ill health crisis state, working together with health and social care partners is both a necessity and a priority. All professionals agree to ensure that the welfare and dignity of the patient is at the heart of any negotiation. <strong><a href="/media/1199/mental-health-crisis-interagency-joint-working-protocol-april-2015.pdf" target="_blank" title="Mental Health Crisis interagency jt working protocl April 2015">The Protocol can be found here. </a></strong></p>
<h2>Information Sharing Protocol</h2>
<p>The <a href="/media/1084/wob-sab-information-sharing-protocol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Information Sharing Protocol"><strong>Information Sharing Protocol</strong></a> covers all of the agencies that form the West of Berkshire Safeguarding Adults Board in the three local authority areas of Reading, West Berkshire and Wokingham. It provides a framework for making decisions about sharing information in order to help protect vulnerable adults who may be at risk of abuse or neglect. The Protocol offers guidance to front-line staff in assessing possible risk to adults, and in balancing the risk against the rights to confidentiality and privacy.  See also the Government's <strong><a href="/media/1139/information-sharing-posters.pdf" target="_blank" title="Information Sharing 7 Rules poster">Seven Golden Rules for Information Sharing</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>At-Risk Pathway for working with those who chose not to engage</h2>
<p>Adults at risk who, for whatever reason, do not engage with services can have complex and diverse needs that often fall between different agencies; their needs are generally longstanding and recurring and put themselves and others at high risk. The <a href="/media/1086/west-of-berkshire-at-risk-pathway-april-2014.pdf" target="_blank" title="At Risk Pathway"><strong>At-Risk Pathway </strong></a>needs to be followed where the level of risk previously being managed has now reached a level that is unacceptable, and all other reasonable attempts to minimise this risk have failed.</p>
<h2>Out of Area Review Procedure</h2>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide clarity and guidance to staff when they are carrying out reviews for people who are placed in out of area supported living, residential or nursing home care. This is to ensure that the quality of the service is of a safe and satisfactory standard and is fully addressing all of the individual’s needs.

<p>Making Safeguarding Personal is not simply about gaining an individual's consent, although that is important, but also about hearing people's views about what they want as an outcome. This means that they are given opportunities at all stages of the safeguarding process to say what they would like to change; this might be about not having further contact with a person who poses a risk to them, changing an aspect of their care plan, asking that someone who has hurt them apologises, or pursuing the matter through the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The views, wishes and desired outcomes of the adult are equally important should the adult lack mental capacity to make informed decisions about their safety, or have <em>substantial difficulty</em> in making their views known and participating in the enquiry process. Personalised practice approaches should still be taken in such cases, including engaging with the person's representative, appointing an independent advocate where appropriate, using what information is known and finding out what the adult would have considered important in decisions about their life, and by following best practice as laid out in the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice 2007.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">The Making Safeguarding Personal Toolkit contains models, theories and approaches to skills and specialist areas that safeguarding practitioners need to be aware of. It can be used as a practitioner guide for pointers on how to respond to individual cases, or as a resource for service development.  It will develop over time as innovative and effective practice comes to light. <strong><a href="http://www.local.gov.uk/documents/10180/6869714/Making+safeguarding+personal_a+toolkit+for+responses_4th+Edition+2015.pdf/1a5845c2-9dfc-4afd-abac-d0f8f32914bc" target="_blank" title="Making Safeguarding Personal">Making Safeguarding Personal - a toolkit for responses</a>.</strong></li>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Having mental capacity means being able to understand and retain information and to make a decision based on that information. Someone might not have capacity because they have: A learning disability; Dementia; A mental health problem; A brain injury or a stroke.</p>
<p>The law aims to ensure that people who lack capacity to make decisions by themselves get the support they need to be as involved as possible in decisions about their lives. It also outlines how an assessment of mental capacity should be made, in which situations other people can make decisions for someone who cannot act on their own and how people can plan ahead in case they become unable to make decisions in the future.</p>
<p>There are five principles at the heart of MCA which should be used to underpin all actions and decisions taken in relation to those who lack capacity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Principle 1: A presumption of capacity. </strong><em>Every adult has the right to make his or her own decisions and must be assumed to have capacity to do so unless it is proved otherwise. Do not assume that someone cannot make a decision for themselves just because they have a particular medical condition or disability.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Principle 2: Individuals being supported to make their own decisions.</strong> <em>Make every effort to encourage and support people to make the decision for themselves. If lack of capacity is established, it is still important to involve the person as far as possible in making decisions.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Principle 3: Unwise decisions. </strong><em>People have the right to make what others might regard as an unwise or eccentric decision.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Principle 4: Best interests.</strong><em> If a person has been assessed as lacking capacity then any action taken, or any decision made for, or on behalf of that person, must be made in his or her best interests.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Principle 5: Less restrictive option. </strong><em>Someone making a decision or acting on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must consider whether it is possible to decide or act in a way that would interfere less with the person’s rights and freedoms of action, or whether there is a need to decide or act at all.</em></p>

<h3>Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS)</h3>
<p>When someone lacks mental capacity to consent to care or treatment, it is sometimes necessary to deprive them of their liberty in their best interests, to protect them from harm. The Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards are intended to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Protect people who lack mental capacity from being detained when this is not in their best interests;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To prevent arbitrary detention;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To give people the right to challenge a decision.</p>
<p>The legislation sets out a procedure for care homes and hospitals to obtain authorisation to deprive someone of their liberty. Without that authorisation the deprivation of liberty will be unlawful. These safeguards are intended to protect people from being deprived of their liberty unless it is in their best interests to protect them from harm and there is no other less restrictive alternative.</p>

<p>The Berkshire Safeguarding Adults Boards have developed Guidance for Multi-Agency Reviews of Serious Cases in order to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">We have processes for learning and reviewing that are flexible and proportionate and open to professional and public challenge.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">We can determine locally what type of review is appropriate dependent on the nature of the case and the agencies involved.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">A culture of transparency is created that provides for a positive shared learning culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>This document sets out the Boards’ expectations for a Safeguarding Adult Review of a serious case, within which there is room for professional judgement and flexibility: <strong><a href="/media/1090/guidance-for-multi-agency-safeguarding-adults-reviews-of-serious-cases-april-2014.pdf" target="_blank" title="SAR Guidance">Guidance for Multi-Agency Reviews of Serious Cases</a></strong></p>
<p>The Board has set out a process for Board members, managers and practitioners, in order to clarify the different roles and responsibilities of individual agencies, the Safeguarding Adults Board and its Subgroups. This includes a notification report template to be completed by anyone wishing to present a case for consideration by the SAR Panel.  The <strong>SAR Panel Process and Notification Report Template can be found <a href="/media/1294/sar-panel-process-and-notification-form-aug-2017.docx" target="_blank" title="SAR Process">here</a>.</strong></p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The main objective of the Board, as set out by the Care Act 2014, is to gain assurance that local safeguarding arrangements help and protect adults with care and support needs who are at risk of or experiencing abuse.  The Board aims to make sure that all of the organisations involved have effective safeguarding policies and procedures and work together in the best way possible to protect adults at risk. The three core duties of the Board are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish an annual strategic plan;</li>
<li>Publish an annual report; and</li>
<li>Conduct Safeguarding Adults Reviews of serious cases in specific circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Statutory safeguarding responsibilities arise where there is reasonable cause to suspect that an adult:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has needs for care and support (whether or not the authority is meeting any of those needs);</li>
<li>Is experiencing, or is at risk of, abuse or neglect; and</li>
<li>As a result of those needs is unable to protect himself or herself against the abuse or neglect, or the risk of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The key functions of the Board are to:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Offer advice and assistance regarding safeguarding responsibilities and promote the understanding that ‘safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility’.</li>
<li>Co-ordinate what is done by each person or body represented on the Board for the purposes of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of adults in the area.</li>
<li>Ensure the effectiveness of what is done by each person or body for safeguarding adults.</li>

<p>Board Meetings are chaired by an Independent Chair and the Board is supported by a Business Manager.</p>
<h3><strong>Links to other Forums and Boards</strong></h3>
<p>The Board is committed to working with other local forums and boards to ensure efforts are not duplicated and that there are no gaps in policy or practice. The Board continues to strengthen its links with HealthWatch, Local Safeguarding Children's Boards, the Community Safety Partnerships, Domestic Abuse Forums and the Health and Well-being Boards.</p>
<p>A Protocol has been agreed with the Health and Well-being Boards to ensure there is an on-going and direct relationship with regular communication.  <strong><a href="/media/1115/protocol-agreement-between-sapb-and-hwb.pdf" target="_blank" title="Protocol with SAB">Protocol between the Health and Well-being Boards and the Safeguarding Adults Board.</a></strong></p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Communication Strategy</strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The purpose of the Board’s <strong><a href="/media/1228/sab-communication-strategy-december-2016.pdf" target="_blank" title="Communication Strategy">Communication Strategy</a> </strong>is to support the messages that safeguarding is everyone’s business, and that good communication is the responsibility of all partners sitting on the Safeguarding Adults Board.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Board has a responsibility to communicate with vulnerable people and the general public about Berkshire’s Safeguarding Policy and Procedures and what each partner agency can do to support them through the safeguarding process.</p>
<h2><strong>Information Sharing Protocol</strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <a href="/media/1084/wob-sab-information-sharing-protocol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Information Sharing Protocol"><strong>Information Sharing Protocol</strong> </a>covers all of the agencies that form the Safeguarding Adults Board. It provides a framework for making decisions about sharing information in order to help protect vulnerable adults who may be at risk of abuse or neglect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Care Act introduces a new duty for Safeguarding Adults Boards. In essence section 45 of the Care Act means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A person must supply information on request by the SAB if he/she is likely to have information relevant to the SAB’s functions.</li>
<li>The information can be about the person, or a function or activity they engage in, or a person in respect of whom they exercise the function / activity.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The power to request information could be used when carrying out a Safeguarding Adults Review, but might also assist in the context of an on-going safeguarding investigation, particularly if issues are raised about the disclosure of relevant information.  The request places the person it is made to under a duty to disclose. It is the Board rather than Adult Social Care or any other agency which has the power to request disclosure. The Board has agreed an arrangement for requesting information in urgent cases, as outlined in this document, <strong><a href="/media/1112/duty-to-apply-powers-under-s45x.pdf" target="_blank" title="Arrangements to apply power S45">Arrangements to Apply the SAB's Powers under S45 of the Care Act.</a></strong></p>]]></bodyText>
        <introText><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of the Communication Strategy and Information Sharing Protocol is to support the messages that safeguarding is everyone’s business, and that clear, timely communication is the responsibility of all partners of the Safeguarding Adults Board.</p>]]></introText>

The Board identifies strategic priorities that shapes its work. These are reviewed each year and revised to reflect findings from performance information and case reviews:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Priority 1 - We have oversight of the quality of safeguarding performance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Priority 2 - We listen to service users, raise awareness of safeguarding adults and help people engage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Priority 3 - We learn from experience and have a skilled and knowledgeable workforce.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Priority 4 – We work together effectively to support people at risk.</p>

<p>The Berkshire Safeguarding Adults Boards have developed Guidance for Multi-Agency Reviews of Serious Cases in order to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">We have processes for learning and reviewing that are flexible and proportionate and open to professional and public challenge.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">We can determine locally what type of review is appropriate dependent on the nature of the case and the agencies involved.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">A culture of transparency is created that provides for a positive shared learning culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>This document sets out the Boards’ expectations for a Safeguarding Adult Review of a serious case, within which there is room for professional judgement and flexibility. <strong><a href="/media/1090/guidance-for-multi-agency-safeguarding-adults-reviews-of-serious-cases-april-2014.pdf" target="_blank" title="SAR Guidance">Guidance for Multi-Agency Reviews of Serious Cases</a></strong></p>
<p>Under the Care Act each member of the SAB must co-operate in and contribute to the carrying out of a review. The Board has set out a process for Board members, managers and practitioners, in order to clarify the different roles and responsibilities of individual agencies, the Safeguarding Adults Board and its Subgroups. This includes a notification report template to be completed by anyone wishing to present a case for consideration by the SAR Panel.  The <strong>SAR Panel Process and Notification Report Template can be found <a href="/media/1294/sar-panel-process-and-notification-form-aug-2017.docx" target="_blank" title="SAR Process">here.</a></strong></p>
